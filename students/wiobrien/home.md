## The GISAID Initiative
### https://www.gisaid.org/about-us/mission/

GISAID is a non-profit initiative recognized by the European Commission as a parter in the PREDEMICS (Prepardness, Prediction and the Prevention of Emerging Zoonotic Viruses with PAndemic Potential) consortium. As such, their research regarding COVID19 has been multinational and exhaustive. A number of the following sources utilize GISAID data in their own analysis, emphasizing its importance in the field of bio-informatics.

## Folding @ Home Project
### https://foldingathome.org/

The Folding @ Home Project is based in St. Louis at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. Their research investigates the protein folds in human cells which are integral to ensuring proper cell functionality. Misfolds in this proteins can result in serious alterations of functionality, possibly introducing serious health complications. Users can donate their own computing power to the research of these folds by visiting the URL above.

## Next Strain
### https://nextstrain.org/ncov

Next Strain aggregates data into a tree-based representation of the fluctuation of COVID19 as it spreads into new territories. The distance of a particular node from the root correlates with the number of mutations of that particular instance of COVID19. The default view shows 3414 genomes but far more can be viewed if the user narrows the time/geographical ranges. The parent site, nextstrain.org, contains a plethora of data and analysis from a broad range of international sources. Analyses and reports can be found for each datasource and genome.

## Complete Genome Sequence of a 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Strain Isolated in Nepal
### https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20

A complete genome sequence of an instance of COVID-19 can be viewed from the data embedded in this study. This particular strand originates from a 32-year old patient who contracted COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. He then travelled to Nepal where he was diagnosed and studied. Research on this full genome can help research the evolution of COVID-19 and aid in the development of vaccines and treatment. The data is readibly available for individual research.

## Best practices for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data: Genomics, Evolution, and Cheminformatics
### https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/

The Galaxy Project analyzes data from GISAID in order to investigate the genomics, evolution, and cheminformatics of COVID-19. The site uses open-source data-science tools to provide easily-modifiable templates and workflows for analysis on each of the fields above. These templates can be downloaded and modified easily, making best-practice tools available for public use.
