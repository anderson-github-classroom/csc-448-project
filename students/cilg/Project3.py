# ## Project Part 3 (a.k.a. Project 3 on Schedule)
# For project 3, I would like you to continue working on your project 2 line of investigation OR pivot to something different depending on your results or understanding or feedback on project 2. I will work to review project 2 submissions this week, so I can provide more individualized feedback as well as extract some highlights.
