## Week 1

This week will be focused on looking at websites to give a brief intro to COVID-19

### GISAID

GISAID, also known as Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, is an online resource that helps give easy public access to not only data related to the flu, but also data concerning the corona virus. This site will be very helpful in acquiring different COVID-19 genome sequences to analyze. 

### Folding@Home

Folding@Home is a distributed computing project for simulation protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins in diseases. To help in the COVID-19 efforts, the site is dedicating more and more of its resources to understanding how the corona virus proteins work and how they can design therapeutics to stop the proteins. I believe that this site will provide different corona virus simulation which will give us some insight into how it works. 

### NextStrain

NextStrain appears to be a site that can provide great data on COVID-19. It contains a detailed phylogeny of COVID-19, showing over 3000 sampled genomes, and it also has a graph depicting the transmissions of corona virus across the globe to different nations. You also have the ability to see where it spread to at the start of the outbreak.

### MRA.ASM 

This site is basically a published article by the American Society for Microbiology that reports a complete genome sequence of a COVID-19 strain isolated in Nepal. After trying to read the article, I can safely say that they use some high level biology techniques to sequence the genome. 

### GalaxyProject

Galaxy Project is a site dedicated to providing best practices and workflows for analyzing COVID-19 data. The only three types of analyses that they feature are genomics, evolution, and cheminformatics. They also provide open source tools for anaylzing data sets. I think this site will be really useful in providing a framework for us to use in analyzing our COVID-19 data.
