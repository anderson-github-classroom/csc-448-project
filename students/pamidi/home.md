## Data collection for the project

### NCBI - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/

National Center for Biotechnology information houses a seriers of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine.
The link above contains uselfull information such as Nucleotide Sequences, SRA Sequences, Protein Structures, Genome Expression studies which may be helpfull for our project.

### GSAID https://www.gisaid.org/ -

The GISAID Initiative promotes the international sharing of all influenza virus sequences, related clinical and epidemiological data associated with human viruses, and geographical as well as species-specific data associated with avian and other animal viruses, to help researchers understand how the viruses evolve, spread and potentially become pandemics
