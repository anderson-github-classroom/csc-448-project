1. GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/)

The GISAID is an organization that promotes the sharing of all influenza virus sequences. The more pertenant one for our class is the information regarding COVID-19. This site contains a visual/detailed representation of the phylogeny for COVID-19. This will be useful when we learn more about phylogeny and how to analyze them

2. Folding (https://foldingathome.org/)

Folding@Home is a project focused on disease research. The organization is trying to solve BioInformatics problems that require heave computer usage and are asking for people to join the initiatize so that unused computer power can be user by Folding@Home organization.Folding@Home focuses on the issues of diseases being caused by incorrect protein folding. The organization wants to gain a better understanding on this topic.


3. Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/ncov)

Next Strain focuses on developing real time tracking of pathogen evolution. In regards to COVID-19 the Nextstrain team is using data from GISAID to conduct analysis on the phenology of the virus. Nextstrain provides a well detailed visual representaiton of COVID-19 over time.

4. ASM Microbiology (https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20)

ASM Microbiology published a paper dicussing the complete genome sequence from a COVID-19 patient traveling from Wuhan, the origin of the virus. The paper goes dicusses comparisions between the COVID-19 genome sequence from this patient and the data already known about SARS

5. COVID-19 Galaxy Project (https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/)

The GalaxyProject is developing a resource to provide infrastructure on SARS-CoV-2 analyses. The GalaxyProject is split into three research areas: Genomics,Evolution, and Cheminoformatics. The Genomics section contains data on complete sequences. The Evolution section focuses on what positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may be subjected to positive or negative selection. The Cheminoformatics sections focuses on protein analysis.
