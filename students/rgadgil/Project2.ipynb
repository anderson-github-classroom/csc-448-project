We need to be critical of this work and look for problems and ways to improve it. We need to be skeptical scientists.

Try to approach this in a genuine way about what you are interested in contributing."

    "We've said many times. This project isn't about everyone reaching the same point in a predetermined set of steps. It's about applying what we are learning in class to produce real data analysis for the community. It is about as *Learn by doing* as you could possibly get at Cal Poly. So what should you be doing this week for the project? Here is some guidance (but remember this is only to guide you and not box you into specific tasks). They are in no particular order. \n",
    "* Consider what questions we want to ask from our evolutionary tree analysis. Think about what questions the book was trying to answer. Do we even have the data in this notebook to answer some of those questions? If not, spend time trying to find it now that you can know more about what to look for in terms of format. Do some literature searching and see what other work has been done for this virus and others.\n",
    "* Research and try different evolutionary tree programs/frameworks. What I've done below is not the only game in town by far. Biopython itself has different options.\n",
    "* Consider the alignment itself. Are there different ways to do this? Did we do it correctly?\n",
    "* What about the sequences themselves? Are they all of the same quality? Should we exclude some?\n",
    "* What about the virus alignment program? Did we use that correctly? Should we have done the entire sequence instead of using Spike as a reference? Should we try a different reference. \n",
    "* Do we have more data available about the sequences? Part of world, etc. Can we do some digging here to answer different questions.\n",
    "* And I'm sure you can think of more to attempt... Think about what you want to do. Spend time working towards a well thoughtout goal. Document things as you go. Talk to everyone on Slack. Together we can do this!"
