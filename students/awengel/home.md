# COVID-19 Summary Page
This page will serve as my collection of COVID-19 information and data analysis
over the course of the next several weeks.

# Week 1 Summary Links
For this week, our assignment was to investigate and summarize the links below.

## The GISAID Initiative
[https://www.gisaid.org/](https://www.gisaid.org/)

From their website:
> The GISAID Initiative promotes the international sharing of all influenza virus sequences, related clinical and epidemiological data associated with human viruses, and geographical as well as species-specific data associated with avian and other animal viruses, to help researchers understand how the viruses evolve, spread and potentially become pandemics.

In short, The GISAID Initiative allows biologists from around the world to upload genome sequences.  This is particularly relevant for the coronavirus, where there has been an unprecented amount of sequences submitted.

Something particularly interesting on the site is [this graph](https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/), which displays how the genome of the virus, has changed over time and location.

## Folding@Home
[https://foldingathome.org/](https://foldingathome.org/)

From their website:
> Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics.

In short, Folding@Home allows people from all over the world "donate" their computing power when they aren't using it so that biologists can run simulations on them.  The simulations that are focused on are folding proteins to be able to identify their structure.  Currently, the team is starting simulations of COVID-19 proteins, which can hopefully be used in the future for finding a cure.

## Nextstrain
[https://nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)

From their website:
> Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data alongside powerful analytic and visualization tools for use by the community. Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response. If you have any questions, or simply want to say hi, please give us a shout at hello@nextstrain.org.

In short, Nextstrain provides real-time graphing of pathogen evolution.  The above link leads to a web application that, using the data from GISAID (mentioned above), shows how the virus spread from one country to another over time.

## Specific Case Data
[https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20](https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20)

ASM is one of the largest life science societies in the world.  The above link goes to a publication in the ASM journals, which details how a specific Nepalese patient contracted Coronavirus and was tested.  The paper goes in-depth on how the test was conducted, how different mutations/strains of the virus occur, and how the virus is structured.  It is also accompanied by the genomic data acquired.

## Galaxy Project
[https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/)

From their website:
> Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research.

Specifically, the above link goes to the COVID-19 hub, which has the description:
> The goal of this resource is to provide publicly accessible infrastructure and workflows for SARS-CoV-2 data analyses. We currently feature three different types of analyses: Genomics, Evolution, and Cheminformatics.

In short, the Galaxy Project is a hub for people all around the world to perform open-sourced scientific research.  This includes people like us doing COVID-19 research from home!  There are many resources on this site for getting Coronavirus data, tutorials on how to analyze said data, etc.
