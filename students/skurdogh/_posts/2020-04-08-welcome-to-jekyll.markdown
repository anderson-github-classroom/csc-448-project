### 1) [Complete Genome Sequence of a 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Strain Isolated in Nepal](https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20)
##### **Overview**
A swab specimen of a Nepalese resident, who acquired the virus in Wuhan, China, and imported it to Nepal, allowed for a complete genome sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain. This journal was written in early February and published in early March, so the information is from earlier stages of the pandemic.
##### **Sequencing Process**
- The swab specimen is of a 32-year-old man
- The specimen tested positve for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
- There were 5,246,584 paired-end sequences in the raw data

##### **The Genome Sequence of Coronavirus 2019**
- The swab specimen genome was compared to two previously sequenced genomes for SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China
  - There was >99.99% identity
- The final sequenced genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a single, positive-stranded RNA 
  - 29,811 nucleotides long
- Nucleotide breakdown:
  - 29.86% adenosines
  - 18.39% cytosines
  - 19.63% guanines
  - 32.12% thymines








<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
