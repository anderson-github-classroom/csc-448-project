### 1) [Complete Genome Sequence of a 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Strain Isolated in Nepal](https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20)
#### **Overview**
A swab specimen of a Nepalese resident, who acquired the virus in Wuhan, China, and imported it to Nepal, allowed for a complete genome sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain. This journal was written in early February and published in early March, so the information is from earlier stages of the pandemic.
#### **Sequencing Process**
- The swab specimen is of a 32-year-old man
- The specimen tested positve for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
- There were 5,246,584 paired-end sequences in the raw data

#### **The Genome Sequence of Coronavirus 2019**
- The swab specimen genome was compared to two previously sequenced genomes for SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China
  - There was >99.99% identity
- The final sequenced genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a single, positive-stranded RNA 
  - 29,811 nucleotides long
- Nucleotide breakdown:
  - 29.86% adenosines
  - 18.39% cytosines
  - 19.63% guanines
  - 32.12% thymines

### 2) [FOLDING@HOME](https://foldingathome.org/)
#### **Overview**
The project's goal is to simulate protein dynamics, like protein folding and movement, in order to understand the diseases that result from protein misfolding. 

This project is powered by distributed computing, which is when multiple computers are used to run components of a software in order to improve performance. It needs to run calculations on millions of computers at a time.

**Fun Fact**: Guinness World Records recognized the Folding@home distributed computing network as the most powerful in the world!

The project hopes to produce results in the form of peer-reviewed publications and public lectures.

#### **How did the Folding project begin?**
- The Folding@Home software went public in the year 2000
- Since then, thousands of computers have contributed to powering research for Alzheimer's, Cancer, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Malaria, and began publishing about coronavirus in March of 2020.
- A more detailed project timeline can be found [here](https://foldingathome.org/project-timeline/)

#### **Here is what the Folding project is doing for COVID-19**
- They want to understand how the coronavirus works so they can design therapeutics to stop them
- The difficulty is that proteins have a lot of moving parts. 
- Biological experiments cannot see all the structures, components, arrangements, and movements that determine the protein's function.
  - So seeing the protein in action is important

#### **Results and Findings**














<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
