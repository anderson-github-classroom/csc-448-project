Folding at home:
----------------
Folding at home is a distributed computing project used for simualting the dynamics of proteins,
including the process of protein folding and protein movements shown in a variety of diseases.
The software can be downloaded on your home computer and will run simulations using your cpu,
and/or gpu. These simulations provide valuable data to scientists for understanding different
diseases, and viruses.
----------------

Next Strain:
------------
Next Strain provides real-time analyitcal data, that is publicly available, visualization about 
the different disease and virus genomes. 
------------

GISAID:
-------
GISAID is an initiative that promotes international sharing of all sequences of influenza viruses,
related clinical and epidemiological data related with human viruses, as well as geographical and 
species-specific data related to other animal viruses. This data assists researchers understand 
how viruses evolve, spread, and potentially become pandemics.
-------

American Society for Microbiology:
----------------------------------
Microbiology Resource Announcements (MRA) is an online open access journal that publishes articles
that announce the availability of any microbiological resources deposited in a repository available 
to the community. MRA coniders prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes anad viruses in public databases
as well as metagenomics sequences, amplicon sequence collections, metabolomics data, proteome data, 
culture collections, mutant libraries, plasmids and other genetic constructs, publicly available 
databases and software, and protocols and workflows.
----------------------------------

Covid-19 Galaxy Project:
------------------------
The Galaxy Project aims to be a resource that provides publicly accessible infrastructure and 
workflows for SARS-CoV-2 data analyses. Current available workflows include the following: 
Genomics, Evolution, Cheminformatics.
