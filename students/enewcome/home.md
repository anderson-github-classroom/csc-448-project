# Project 1

The field of bioinformatics, like other fields, relies heavily on community contributions from scientists around the world. Many of these collaborative resources can aid us in our own study of bioinformatics, and more specifically, our study of COVID-19. The ones that I have come across are listed below.

## GISAID Initiative
### What is it?
The [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide universal access to all influenza virus sequences, as well as their associated epidemiological and geographical data. GISAID stands for Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and is a partnership between the German government and a registered nonprofit called Freunde of Gisaid (Friends of Gisaid). In addition to providing an open-access, influenza virus database, they provide training workshops around the world and aid in the development of new tools for GISAID data analysis.

### Why is it important?
By effectively "open-sourcing" influenza virus sequence data, GISAID has been able to lift the hurdles and restrictions that would otherwise stop bioinformaticians, scientists, and students around the world from finding useful insights about the virus data that they can then provide to the scientific community. It is an extremely important resource to scientists and bioinformaticians alike, especially as we try to learn more about COVID-19.  

### Other cool things/facts:
- In order to access the free database, you must first submit an application that includes basic personal information and an agreement to their database terms. After an applicant's identity is confirmed, they will receive access credentials to the database.

## Folding@Home
### What is it?
Proteins are essential for keeping humans healthy and are assembled when they fold. However, protein misfolding has serious consequences that can lead to the development of many diseases. Folding@Home is a community-driven, distributed computing project that aims to analyze mass amounts of protein folding simulation data. The simulations are time-intensive, which is why the project relies on the contributions of citizen-scientists around the world, who volunteer to run protein dynamics simulations on their personal computers. Users contribute by downloading the Folding@Home software, which runs simulations while you are doing other things.

### Why is it important?
Folding@Home is an amazing project that allows anyone with a computer and an internet connection to contribute to disease research. There are a massive amount of computations that need to be done to study protein dynamics; by sharing unused computer power, more insights can be gained and more cures can be researched. 

### Other cool things/facts:
- The Folding@Home project has a [Diseases page](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/) that includes more information as well as a timeline of their research findings *for every disease that they have studied*. They are organized into 3 categories (cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological diseases) and include diseases such as the Zika virus, Ebola virus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
