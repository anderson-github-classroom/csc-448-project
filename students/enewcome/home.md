# Project 1

There are many existing resources that can aid us in our study of bioinformatics, and more specifically, our study of COVID-19.

## GISAID Initiative
The [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide universal access to all influenza virus sequences, as well as their associated epidemiological and geographical data. GISAID stands for Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and is a partnership between the German government and a registered nonprofit called Freunde of Gisaid (Friends of Gisaid). In addition to providing an open-access, influenza virus database, they provide training workshops around the world and aid in the development of new tools for GISAID data analysis.

By effectively "open-sourcing" influenza virus sequence data, GISAID has been able to lift the hurdles and restrictions that would otherwise stop bioinformaticians, scientists, and students around the world from finding useful insights about the virus data that they can then provide to the scientific community. It is an extremely important resource to scientists and bioinformaticians alike, especially as we try to learn more about COVID-19.  

In order to access the free database, you must first submit an application that includes basic personal information and an agreement to their database terms. After an applicant's identity is confirmed, they will receive access credentials to the database.

## Folding@Home
Proteins are essential for keeping humans healthy and are assembled when they fold. However, protein misfolding has serious consequences that can lead to the development of many diseases. Folding@Home is a community-driven, distributed computing project that aims to analyze mass amounts of protein folding simulation data. The simulations are time-intensive, which is why the project relies on the contributions of citizen-scientists around the world, who volunteer to run protein dynamics simulations on their personal computers. Users contribute by downloading the Folding@Home software, which runs simulations while you are doing other things.

Folding@home is an amazing project that allows anyone with a computer and an internet connection to contribute to disease research. There are a massive amount of computations that need to be done to study protein dynamics; by sharing unused computer power, more insights can be gained and more cures can be researched.
