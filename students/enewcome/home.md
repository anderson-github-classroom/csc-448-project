# Project 1

There are many existing resources that can aid us in our study of bioinformatics, and more specifically, our study of COVID-19.

### GISAID Initiative
The [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide universal access to all influenza virus sequences, as well as their associated epidemiological and geographical data. GISAID stands for Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and is a partnership between the German government and a registered nonprofit called Freunde of Gisaid (Friends of Gisaid). In addition to providing an open-access, influenza virus database, they provide training workshops around the world and aid in the development of new tools for GISAID data analysis.

By effectively "open-sourcing" influenza virus sequence data, GISAID has been able to lift the hurdles and restrictions that would otherwise stop bioinformaticians, scientists, and students around the world from finding useful insights about the virus data that they can then provide to the scientific community. It is an extremely important resource to scientists and bioinformaticians alike, especially as we try to learn more about COVID-19.  

In order to access the free database, you must first submit an application that includes basic personal information and an agreement to their database terms. After an applicant's identity is confirmed, they will receive access credentials to the database.
