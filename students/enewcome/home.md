# Project 1

**The field of bioinformatics, like other fields, relies heavily on community contributions from scientists around the world. Many of these collaborative resources can aid us in our own study of bioinformatics, and more specifically, our study of COVID-19. The ones that I have come across are listed below**.

## [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/)
### What is it?
The [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide universal access to all influenza virus sequences, as well as their associated epidemiological and geographical data. GISAID stands for Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and is a partnership between the German government and a registered nonprofit called Freunde of Gisaid (Friends of Gisaid). In addition to providing an open-access, influenza virus database, they provide training workshops around the world and aid in the development of new tools for GISAID data analysis.

### Why is it important?
By effectively "open-sourcing" influenza virus sequence data, GISAID has been able to lift the hurdles and restrictions that would otherwise stop bioinformaticians, scientists, and students around the world from finding useful insights about the virus data that they can then provide to the scientific community. It is an extremely important resource to scientists and bioinformaticians alike, especially as we try to learn more about COVID-19.  

### Other cool things/facts:
- In order to access the free database, you must first submit an application that includes basic personal information and an agreement to their database terms. After an applicant's identity is confirmed, they will receive access credentials to the database.

## [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)
### What is it?
Proteins are essential for keeping humans healthy and are assembled when they fold. However, protein misfolding has serious consequences that can lead to the development of many diseases. Folding@Home is a community-driven, distributed computing project that aims to analyze mass amounts of protein folding simulation data. The simulations are time-intensive, which is why the project relies on the contributions of citizen-scientists around the world, who volunteer to run protein dynamics simulations on their personal computers. Users contribute by downloading the Folding@Home software, which runs simulations while you are doing other things.

### Why is it important?
Folding@Home is an amazing project that allows anyone with a computer and an internet connection to contribute to disease research. There are a massive amount of computations that need to be done to study protein dynamics; by sharing unused computer power, more insights can be gained and more cures can be researched. 

### Other cool things/facts:
- The Folding@Home project has a [Diseases page](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/) that includes more information as well as a timeline of their research findings *for every disease that they have studied*. 
- All of the diseases they study are organized into 3 categories, being cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological diseases. Their research encompasses a wide range of diseases, such as the Zika virus, Ebola virus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

## [Next Strain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global)
### What is it?
Nest Strain is an open-source project that seeks to combine, understand, visualize, and track pathogen genome data in real time. The primary goal of the project is to increase epidemiological understanding and improve the community's response to the outbreak of viral diseases. Their latest [data and analysis page](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global) contains a dashboard that analyzes and displays the Genetic epidemiology of the novel coronavirus. The main visualization shows the phylogeny (evolutionary history) of the virus, which can be displayed globally and by country.

### Why is it important?
Data visualization in general is an extremely powerful tool that allows for increased comprehension of data analysis, since you don't (usually) need to have scientific/statistical background to understand what is happening in a picture. Furthermore, by visualizing the data in a multitude of ways (similar to the different tree options on the NextStrain dashboard) more relationships/correlations/insights can be found at the click of a button. The Next Strain data visualization dashboard allows users to view how pathogens change over time in a plethora of ways, enabling people everywhere to see and try to understand how viruses  evolve.

### Other cool things/facts:
- This project is made possible using data from GISAID!
- The dashboard provides analysis for 10 different pathogens, including ebola, ncov (novel coronavirus), and zika.
- Nextstrain provides an open-source toolkit that allows anyone to create visualizations like the ones that are seen on the dashboard.
