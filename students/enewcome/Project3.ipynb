    "This week in the US, nearly 20 states will be partially reopening their businesses, following a trend of eased restrictions by many state governors. Despite many Americans being relieved they're able to return to work, many are still worried that this will cause a second surge of COVID-19 cases in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's project, I will be investigating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and reopened states by constructing a USA phylogeny (separated by state) with the most recent data. My goal is to see if there are any consequences for opening early, as measured by new cases of COVID-19. Since many states are just now reopening, the results of this analysis might become more significant over the next few weeks.  "
