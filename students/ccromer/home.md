## [GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/)

The GSAID Initiative (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) is a non-profit that promotes the sharing of virus sequences and related data. They believe it is critically important for this information to be shared freely and made available internationally.

GISAID provides access to a rapidly growing collection of hCov-19 genome sequences, as labratories across the world share their coronavirus data

## [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)

Folding@Home is a citizen-based, distributed project aiming to analyze protein folding data. Understanding the connection between modern diseases and protein misfolding is essential to understanding the diseases themselves. Contributors to the project donate some of their own computing power to run protein dynamics simulations.

Understanding the protein folding process in relation to the coronavirus is essential to making progress against this pandemic. In the past, they have made progress towards Ebola treatment; they hope to do similiar with the novel coronavirus.

## [Next Strain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global)

Nextstrain uses public data (including GISAID Data) with modern analytical and visualization technologies in order to make real-time graphics to help people understand and visualize pathogen genome data. Their main goal is to improve community response towards the outbreak of viral diseases.

Nextstrain has been obtaining and displaying Covid data in realtime on their website. This helps the community view and understand the current pandemic situation.

## [ASM's Complete Genome Sequence of a 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Strain Isolated in Nepal](https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20)

This study shows and analyzes a complete genome sequence obtained for a SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from a patient from Nepal with COVID-19. It analyzes patterns in the genome and compares it with that of other genomes, including discussions on mutations.

The resulted full genome comparison revealed that there was a >99.99% match with two previously sequenced covid genomes. The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a single, 29,811 nucleotides long, positive-stranded RNA.

## [The Galaxy Project](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/)

The Galaxy Project is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research. They provide the best practices for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data: Genomics, Evolution, and Cheminformatics. Their tools serve as free data analysis education for public use.
