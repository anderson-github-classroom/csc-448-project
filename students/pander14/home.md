## General Notes
Please don't worry about the project feeling like something too big to handle. Our first week was to basically get comfortable being uncomfortable with the
amount and diversity of data that is available. We'll work on narrowing our focus in the coming weeks, but anything this important is going to take time.

## Data Gathering and Exploration
One of the first steps to our project is going to be defining and acquiring the right biological data to support our analysis. There are a lot of datasets
available. Complicating matters even more is the fact that we don't necessarily need or want raw data. I am fond of using notebooks for both my text/notes/annotations as well as analysis. Here is one I've started about data gathering.
