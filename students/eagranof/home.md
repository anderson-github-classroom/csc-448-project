# Week 1: Link Discussion

## Overview
With little knowledge of bioinformatics this early in the quarter, this week is meant more to start looking at links and information on COVID-19.

---

## [The GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/)
* GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing ALl Influenza Data) is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to provide public access to genetic sequence data of influenza viruses.
* The database, named EpiFlu, is hosted by the German government and is mainly a German operation, but its services are intended for worldwide use.
* They allow public uploading of genetic sequences and share data.
* With the rise of COVID-19, they now have expanded to include data on the novel coronavirus.
* The website includes multiple graphics analyzing the data submitted for various genome sequences of COVID-19, provided by Nextstrain.
* The EpiFlu database might be a useful resource for acquiring real time data.

---

## [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)
* The "Folding" refers to the folding of proteins.
* By having people volunteer personal computing power, the project is about running simulations of protein dynamics to better understand various biological processes.
* Viruses have proteins that are used to suppress our immune systems as well as reproducing themselves.
* Folding@Home is trying to redirect its research towards COVID-19 and better understanding its protein structure.
* This can lead to discovering therapeutic techniques related to coronavirus.

---

## [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global)
* Nextstrain is an open source project that is meant to help track pathogen evolution using public health data.
* They have a lot of graphics on the evolution of COVID-19, using data from GISAID's EpiFlu database.
* Good visualization tool.

---

## [COVID-19 Analysis on usegalaxy](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/)
* A helpful resource that has workflows to use for analysis of COVID-19.
* There are 3 different workflows for different types of analysis: Genomics, Evolution, and Cheminformatics.
* This can be helpful analyzing as a student since background knowledge is lacking/developing on bioinformatics.

# Week 2

* See [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethana1234/CSC448-work/blob/master/project/exampleTree.ipynb) for the starter code and example of analysis being done for this project. DNA alignment using virulign and Phylogenic tree building. Also includes attempts to use other alignment tools.

---

# Week 3

* See [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethana1234/CSC448-work/blob/master/project/trimercomp.ipynb) for analysis of nucleotide composition of different coronavirus reference genomes. This first notebook is about trimer (3-mer) frequencies in each genome.
* See [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethana1234/CSC448-work/blob/master/project/gccontent.ipynb) for more comparison of coronaviruses. This notebook looks at GC content.

# Week 4
* See [here]() for analysis on how coronavirus mutates and spreads, based on [this](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/science/coronavirus-mutations.html) NYT article.
