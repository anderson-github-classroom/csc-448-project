# **Goal**
This is a weekly analysis of COVID-19 and the coronavirus, incorporating real data generated by leading scientists and institutions.

## **Week 1** 
A review of some current available resources

### [The GISAID Initiative](https://www.gisaid.org/)
    The GISAID Initiative (previously known as a Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) promotes the sharing of data related to human and animal viruses with the purpose of helping researchers comprehend how viruses behave. GISAID fights any restrictions that prevent the spreading of data before it is published formally. The data accumulated in GISAID is available internationally to anyone (who follows GISAID guidelines) for free.  
  #### COVID-19 Efforts
    Currently, the number of hCoV-19 genome sequences being made available on GISAID is rapidly increasing as laboratories all around the world are sharing their findings regarding this pressing, new virus. 


### [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/)
    Folding@home is a project that studies and stimulates various protein dynamics, like the way proteins move in diseases and the folding of protein. It provides a platform for citizen scientists to volunteer and bring their ideas and findings together.
  #### COVID-19 Efforts
    With the understanding that viruses use proteins to suppress the immune system and reproduce, Folding@home is attempting to comprehend how these viral proteins function and develop therapeutics to stop them to contribute to the fight against the coronavirus. Folding@home specializes in using computer simulations to understand the numerous moving parts in a protein. Using these simulations, they were able to locate a site in Ebola proteins that is potentially druggable. They hope to have similar findings with coronavirus proteins.
