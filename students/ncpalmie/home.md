# GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data)

GISAID is an online resource for collecting and sharing information on human viruses. The group aims to provide sequencing data, clinical and epidemiological information, and geographical data relevant to viruses in an attempt to help researchers all around the world access and contribute to our knowledge surrounding viral agents. While the group was initially focused on influenza, they have broadened their scope to include other viruses, such as the novel coronavirus.

# Folding@home

Folding@home is a distributed computing project which allows individuals to contribute to protein research by dedicating their otherwise unused computing resources to simulations on protein folding. With the new coronavirus threat, the service has seen a boom in new users and are trying to reach one million folders to speed up time-sensitive research on the new virus.

# Nextstrain

Nextstrain is an open-source pathogen visualization tool which is attempting to provide an approachable set of data for health experts and officials to better understand how outbreaks are evolving. Their overall goal is to have a continually updated source of information for those trying to get an understanding of how an epidemic or outbreak is playing out.

# Microbiology Resource Announcments

This article hosted by the American Society For Microbiology outlines the complete genome sequence of a strain of the coronavirus that had been contracted by a Nepalese traveler returning from China.

# COVID-19 Analysis on Galaxy Project Website

This resource provides an aggregation of tools, analyses, datasets, and best practices to follow when researching and providing information on the coronavirus. The main three portions of the website cover the virus' genome, evolution, and cheminformatics

# COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE

This GitHub repository is managed by the CSSE team at John Hopkins and provides a collection of datasets and information on the coronavirus from governments and organizations all around the world. Many coronavirus trackers and dashboards are pulling their information from this repo currently.
