1. Folding 

Proteins are essential for performing specific functions in our body. They spontaneously change structure known as "folding" in order to change what they do. 

Similar to us, viruses also have proteins that supress our immune system and reproduce. Our goal is to understand how they work and find therapeutic solutions to combat them, and specifically with coronavirus right now. 

We can do this by using computer simulations to understand the protein's components. This might allow us to identify vulnerabilities and develop remedies to attack the vulnerabilities. Ideally, we want to do the same with coronavirus.
