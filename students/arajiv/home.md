===Week 1===

1. GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/)

This site contains information on the COVID-19 genome and possible entry points for data collection. This site can be useful when we start to perform analysis on actual COVID-19 data and start to get in-depth with the algorithms 

2. Folding (https://foldingathome.org/)

Proteins are essential for performing specific functions in our body. They spontaneously change structure known as "folding" in order to change what they do. 

Similar to us, viruses also have proteins that supress our immune system and reproduce. Our goal is to understand how they work and find therapeutic solutions to combat them, and specifically with coronavirus right now. 

We can do this by using computer simulations to understand the protein's components. This might allow us to identify vulnerabilities and develop remedies to attack the vulnerabilities. Ideally, we want to do the same with COVID-19. 

3. Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/ncov)

This site gives visualizations and graphs on COVID-19 based on its data collected from GISAID. It shows a phylogeny, transmissions chart, and a diversity chart. These are good examples of what further analysis we can perform with the right data. There are also opportunities to filter the data to see the charts in specific regions. 

4. ASM Microbiology (https://mra.asm.org/content/9/11/e00169-20)

This site looks like the findings after conducting an experiment with the COVID-19 genome sampling an infected patient traveling from Wuhan. A lot of it compares to the SARS genome and develops findings by performing algorithms and conducting research alongside SARS data. 

5. COVID-19 Galaxy Project (https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/)

3 research areas were conducted with COVID-19 data: Genomics, Evolution, and Cheminformatics. Genomics mostly concerned where the data is coming from and how the data was sequenced. They are also using evolutionary techniques to identify positive and negative selection. The cheminformatics portion deals with protein analysis.
