# Current Research on COVID-19

## [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/)

GISAID is an organization that collects, categorizes, and organizes virus sequences for analysis.

## [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global)

Nextstrain processes GISAID's huge list of virus sequences and organizes them into an easily-viewable phylogeny of hCoV-19.

# Ways anyone can help RIGHT NOW

## [Folding at Home](https://foldingathome.org/)

Folding at Home is a project that collects the idle processing power of individuals worldwide. Folding at home is currently dedicated to simulating the interactions of hCoV-19 with other molecules to better understand how the virus behaves. Start folding today!
